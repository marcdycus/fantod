# BAMAZON CUSTOMER
**Terminal app that allows you to interact with a database by making a purchase**

When the app runs, it populates an easy-to-read table with all the products, and then asks the user two prompts:

1) Which product you would like to purchase
2) How many of those products you would like to purchase

Then user will be asked to confirm the purchase. If the user confirms, it will continue by checking to see if the table has the amount the user wishes to purchase, and the user will then get one of two responses:

A) `Your transaction is complete`, along with the amount you spent and the quantity of the product you bought.

OR

B) `We're sorry, unfortunately there isn't that many in stock`, only if the amount of products available is less than the users input for quantity.

If the user does not confirm, the application will end at the confirmation section and the purchase will be cancelled.
